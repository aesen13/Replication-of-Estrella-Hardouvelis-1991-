# Replication-of-Estrella-Hardouvelis-1991-
OLS and Probit model code for R, to replicate the models in Estrella &amp; Hardouvelis (1991)
In this repository You will Find the following R scripts:

1. Basic OLS Regressions with adjustable forecasting horizons and dates. Keep in mind that you will have to use your own FRED API key to be able to pull the data as I did. It is very easy to obtain one from FRED's website. 
         -Nevertheless, the extreme interaction term that I use in my thesis can be just manually added to the regression code, you will find it, dont worry :)
         - Basically most of the code is already containing its own captions there, so Im not gonna explain too much here.

2. The probit regression code. Same fashion, ajustable dates, graphs, etc all included in the script. I upload both Probit code for quarterly (main) and monthly testings.
